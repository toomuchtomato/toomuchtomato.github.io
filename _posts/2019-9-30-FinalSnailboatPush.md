title: The Final Push to Launch Snailboat
---

#But is it really the final push?
About a year and a half ago, I decided that I would polish up one of my jam games, add a few quality of life features, and release it on iOS and Android. I thought it would take me a month, but the project has been taking up space in the back of my mind all this time. Granted, I did finish the bulk of the project within one month...

## What I added in one month
* Save system
* Level Select
* Mobile Controls
* Additional "Game Feel"- animations and effects
* New Title art

## Things I wanted to do that kept me from publishing in July 2018
* Polish up the title art and key art to a professional level
* Add more levels
* Make a proper attempt at monetizing
* Get press to write about the game

These things that I thought I wanted were really just holding me back.  Some of them still are holding me back, as I just spent yesterday touching up the title art.  But I feel as if I'm in the final stretch now.
