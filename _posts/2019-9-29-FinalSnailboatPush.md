About a year and a half ago, I decided that I would polish up one of my jam games, add a few quality of life features, and release it on iOS and Android. I thought it would take me a month, but the project has been taking up space in the back of my mind all this time. I finished the majority of the project in one month and was ready to ship. However, there were a lot of aspirations I had for the game that kept me from releasing it into the wild.

### Aspirations that kept me from shipping Snailboat last year
* Polish up the art to a professional level
* Add more levels, people will be unhappy with less than 10
* Make a proper attempt at monetizing
* Get press to write about the game

These thoughts are all well meaning- their intention is for the project to succeed and/or give the support I need to keep making games. Snailboat is the first game I made that was actually fun, and it felt like with a little extra push it could be something extremely special.

On the other hand, this project on the backburner took up mental capacity and confirmed any nasty thoughts I had about "Not being able to finish things". I could have released the game as-is in July and moved onto other projects with confidence that I had shipped a game. Actually, I _did_ move on to other projects, but I can't help thinking I would have felt less burdened with Snailboat released on mobile over the last year.

## A crucial juncture

A few weeks ago at a local game developer meetup, a new member asked if I had any published games on mobile or steam. I consider myself a relatively experienced game developer, but a sudden realization dawned on me that I had never published a game on a legit storefront (itch I still love you!). None of my projects have made it past this crucial juncture in the creative process. This is the point where you have to say *no* to your aspirations in order to keep moving forward. Snailboat still isn't out, the Machine's Garden still isn't out, and _Top Secret Freelance Project_ is, you guessed it, still top secret. Apparently, doing game jams doesn't mean you can automatically finish long term projects. With no time limit or deadline, things can stretch out indefinitely. It's not necessarily a bad thing, but personally I'd like to close chapters so I can flow on to the next thing.

But I do feel as if I'm in the final stretch now. I'm starting to let go of a lot of the unrealistic aspirations and I'm just happy to release this thing I made, even if it isn't perfect.
